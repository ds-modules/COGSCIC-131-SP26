    "In this problem set, we will implement a **perceptron** — a simple neural network — to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reminder - The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an image of a handwritten digit (0-9), can we train a simple neural network to recognize which digit it is? This is a classic machine learning problem that connects to how the brain might learn to categorize visual patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reminder - The Perceptron\n",
    "\n",
    "The perceptron is the simplest neural network:\n",
    "1. It takes **input features** (here, pixel values from an image)\n",
    "2. Each input is multiplied by a **weight**\n",
    "3. The weighted inputs are summed: $y = \\sum_i w_i \\times x_i$\n",
    "4. The output is **thresholded**: output 1 if $y > 0$, else output 0\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning happens by adjusting weights when the perceptron makes mistakes:\n",
    "- If it should have output 1 but didn't: **increase** weights for active inputs\n",
    "- If it should have output 0 but didn't: **decrease** weights for active inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "## This Problem Set\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll:\n",
    "1. Load and visualize MNIST handwritten digit images\n",
    "2. Implement the perceptron output function\n",
    "3. Implement the perceptron learning rule\n",
    "4. Train a perceptron to distinguish \"0\" from \"1\"\n",
    "5. Explore what the trained weights reveal about digit features\n",
    "6. Extend to classifying all digit pairs\n",
